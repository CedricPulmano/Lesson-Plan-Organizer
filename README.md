# Lesson-Plan-Organizer
Users can track the progress of students as they learn lessons, which may have requirements to teach, from teachers.
There is a console application with a lot of functions, a basic user interface, and an option to save and load data.

The main program is written in Java, while Java Swing was used to create the UI.

Run LessonPlannerMainConsole to use the console
Run LessonPlannerMainGUI to use the user interface

Feel free to suggest any changes or fixes.
Thank you for your interest in my project, please enjoy!
